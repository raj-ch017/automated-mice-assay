# Python Code

This folder contains Python scripts used for backing up, processing, and analyzing data generated from the assay system.

## Files

- **data_backup**  
  This script automates the backup of data generated by the PLX-DAQ Excel file. It prompts the user for a folder location to store the backup. The script creates a `xlsx` file inside the selected folder that copies the PLX-DAQ-generated data into it, renaming the file as per the name entered by the user.

- **analysing_data_script**  
  This script performs data analysis on the backed-up assay data. It prompts the user to select the backup file. The script reads the Excel file, processes the data to extract and organize information for each individual mouse, and creates a dedicated subfolder for each mouse. It then saves processed data files and corresponding graphs into the respective folders for streamlined analysis and visualization.

## Notes

- These scripts are designed to work together as part of the assay data workflow.
- Ensure necessary Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `matplotlib`) are installed before running the scripts.
- File and folder selection dialogs require a graphical interface.
