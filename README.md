Repository Structure
</h2>
</p>

### 1. `arduino_code/`

Contains Arduino sketches for controlling and testing hardware components of the assay system.

- **assay_code**  
  The main code uploaded to the Arduino to run the assay.

- **light_brightness**  
  Test code to check the LED panels with varying light intensity.

- **servo_test**  
  Test code to verify the servo motor’s rotation speed and operation, used with the door prototype.

- **trail_for_sensor**  
  Test code to check the IR sensor’s input and verify correct data reading and sensor functionality.

### 2. `python_code/`

Contains Python scripts for data management and analysis.

- **data_backup**  
  A Python script that automates backing up data generated by the PLX-DAQ Excel file. It prompts the user to select a destination folder, creates a timestamped subfolder, and copies the PLX-DAQ output as `assay_data.xlsx` for standardized storage.

- **analysing_data_script**  
  A Python script that analyzes the backed-up assay data. It asks the user to choose the backup folder, processes the Excel data to extract information for each mouse, creates individual folders per mouse, and saves processed data along with generated graphs in the corresponding folders.

> **Note:** These scripts require Python libraries such as `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `matplotlib`. Please install them using `pip` before running.

### 3. `videos/`

This folder contains demonstration videos documenting the development and operation of the assay system, including hardware, software, and data workflows. Each video corresponds to a specific stage or functionality. These videos serve as a visual supplement to the documentation of the assay system, providing insights into both the hardware setup and the data processing pipeline.
