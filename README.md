This repository contains all the code and resources used for automating, testing, and analyzing the assay system. It includes Arduino scripts for hardware control, Python scripts for data backup and analysis.

A presentation describing the building of the assay can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Ek6WIwjY0hH0F-YlwTNMf6eIfvuUplWb).

Videos can also be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fu83q5RRfNSrUpR8kO0EHiGRxu_OUm8t/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1).

Repository Structure
</h2>
</p>

### 1. `arduino_code/`

Contains Arduino sketches for controlling and testing hardware components of the assay system.

- **assay_code**  
  The main code uploaded to the Arduino to run the assay.

- **light_brightness**  
  Test code to check the LED panels with varying light intensity.

- **servo_test**  
  Test code to verify the servo motor‚Äôs rotation speed and operation, used with the door prototype.

- **trail_for_sensor**  
  Test code to check the IR sensor‚Äôs input and verify correct data reading and sensor functionality.

### 2. `python_code/`

Contains Python scripts for data management and analysis.

- **data_backup**  
A Python script that automates the backup of data generated by the PLX-DAQ Excel file. The script creates a `xlsx` file that copies the PLX-DAQ-generated data into it, renaming the file as per the name entered by the user.

- **analysing_data_script**  
  A Python script that analyzes the backed-up assay data. The script reads the Excel file, processes the data to extract and organize information for each individual mouse, and creates a dedicated subfolder for each mouse. It then saves processed data files and corresponding graphs into the respective folders for streamlined analysis and visualization.

> **Note:** These scripts require Python libraries such as `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and `matplotlib`. Please install them using `pip` before running.

### 3. `videos/`

This folder contains demonstration videos documenting the development and operation of the assay system, including hardware, software, and data workflows. Each video corresponds to a specific stage or functionality. These videos serve as a visual supplement to the documentation of the assay system, providing insights into both the hardware setup and the data processing pipeline.
