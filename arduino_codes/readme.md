# Arduino Code

This folder contains the Arduino code used for developing and testing various components of the assay system. Below is a description of each file:

## Files

- **assay_code**  
  The main Arduino program uploaded to the device to run the assay protocol. This code integrates the core functionality required for the assay operation.

- **light_brightness**  
  Test code for verifying the LED panels. It allows testing of LED brightness across different intensity levels to calibrate or troubleshoot illumination.

- **servo_test**  
  Test code for evaluating the servo motor performance. This code checks the rotation speed and functionality of the servo motor used in the door prototype.

- **trail_for_sensor**  
  Test code for verifying the IR sensor input. It monitors the sensorâ€™s response and ensures correct data capture from the infrared sensor during trials.

## Notes

- These scripts are intended for testing and development purposes.
- Ensure the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE before uploading any code.
- Modify parameters within test scripts as needed based on your hardware setup.
